<h2>Project introduction</h2>
<p>The construction of an online education platform can improve students' initiative and autonomy in learning, break the constraints of time and place, and make the learning environment more free. With the full development of online education, people can study directly at home, reducing space costs. Online education has a wide range of time and no time limit, which is more conducive to people to arrange their own time. Online education can enhance people's mastery of knowledge. People can use features like audition and then make their next choice, which is not possible with offline education.</p>
<p>It is necessary to learn to use Node.js, VS Code, GitHub and other software to complete the establishment of an online education platform through the combination of various software.</p>
