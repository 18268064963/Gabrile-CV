<h2> Individual resume </h2>
<h1>Education</h1>
<p>I am currently studying in Ningbo City Vocational and Technical College, studying computer application technology. Our courses include Advanced English, English Listening, English Reading, My SQL, etc.My grades were not very good in the class, hovering between the average, I am now working hard to improve myself so that I can graduate with honors.</p>
<h1>Hobby</h1>
<p>My hobby is studying computers, studying the components of computers, studying the various parts of computers. In my free time, I will spend time by playing computer games, or participating in sports such as basketball, badminton, tennis, etc.</p>
<h1>Favorite course</h1>
<p>My favorite course is English reading, English reading can be my faster learning English vocabulary and application of English. There is also a My SQL course, which allows me to have a preliminary grasp of My SQL, and I can master this software more quickly in the future study. I also particularly like the school's physical education classes, which can make me relax after study, combine work and rest, and make study more efficient.</p>
<h1>Features introduction</h1>  
<p>My strength is that I am more curious, like to fiddle with various problems, and often learn new knowledge because of some things, but this knowledge may not be commonly used. And my shortcoming is that it is easy to give up halfway, often because the problem may be more complicated, and the solution takes a certain amount of time to give up.</p>
<p>I can take advantage of my curiosity and easy acceptance of new things, to constantly study new things, keep up with the pace of the times, and not rest on my laurels. When faced with a problem, we must rise to the challenge and not back down.</p>
